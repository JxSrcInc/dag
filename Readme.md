# Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Demo

## Installation and Run
This demo is a Spring Boot application without the default web starter, and it utilizes Maven to manage Java dependencies.

To run this application, follow these steps:
1. Import the project into Eclipse.
2. Run it as a Java application.

## Define DAG Graph
Create a DAG graph by specifying vertex and edge sets in DagApplication.java. Ensure that there are no cycles or closed paths in the graph.

Specify the start vertex in the same file.

View the longest path in the console output.

## Questions and Answers

Q: Does the solution work for larger graphs? 

A: Yes, the solution is designed to work for graphs of various sizes.

Q: Can you think of any optimizations? 

A: While optimizations are possible, the algorithm for finding the longest path is inherently complex. Further investigation is needed for specific optimizations.

Q: Whatâ€™s the computational complexity of your solution? 

A: The computational complexity is influenced by the algorithm used to compute the longest path. It would depend on factors such as the size and structure of the graph.

Q: Are there any unusual cases that aren't handled?

A: The solution assumes that the input graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). If the graph contains cycles, the output becomes unpredictable. Ensuring the graph is acyclic is crucial for accurate results.
