## Installation and Run
This demo is a Spring Boot application without the default web starter, and it utilizes Maven to manage Java dependencies.

To run this application, follow these steps:
1. Import the project into Eclipse.
2. Run it as a Java application.

## Define DAG Graph
Create a DAG graph by specifying vertex and edge sets in DagApplication.java. Ensure that there are no cycles or closed paths in the graph.

Specify the start vertex in the same file.

View the longest path in the console output.
